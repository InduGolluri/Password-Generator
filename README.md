# Password-Generator


### Password Generator

The Password Generator is a Python script designed to assist users in creating strong and secure passwords. It combines letters, symbols, and numbers to produce passwords that are difficult to guess, enhancing online security.

#### Objective
The main goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use tool that generates complex passwords, helping users protect their accounts from unauthorized access.

#### Features
- **User Input**: Users can specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password.
- **Random Character Selection**: The script randomly selects characters from each specified category.
- **Shuffling**: The selected characters are shuffled to ensure unpredictability.
- **Password Display**: The generated password is displayed for the user to copy and use.

This project serves both practical security purposes and as a means to improve programming skills.
